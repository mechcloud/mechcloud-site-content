A Technical Cloud Solutions Architect with 15+ years of experience who is into product development, solution engineering, devops and itops. With my knowledge landscape spanning (and covering atleast 30%) to all these areas, I am either able to operate independently or drive teams across these areas towards a common goal and execute projects with greater speed which otherwise suffer due to disconnect among these areas. 
I play all these roles for my free/OSS projects. I have setup a number of tools (kubernetes clusters, VMware vRA/vSphere/NSX-T, Wireguard VPN, DNS Server for private domain, internal certificate authority etc) for my solution engineering team from scratch to improve their output by 3x. Good understanding of advanced networking concepts (e.g. linux bridge, Open vSwitch, vSphere standard/distributed switch, overlay(VXLAN, GRE, GENEVE). 

Here are some of the things which I can handle across these areas on my own - 

Product Engineering 
-------------------
* Designing and developing javascript/java/python based web applications/micro services. 
* Writing CSS frameworks. 
* Finding innvotive ways to design/develop/run applications (e.g. spliting a vuejs application into multiple independent applications to fully isolate design/development/testing/deployment phases for these independent applications) 

Solution Engineering 
-------------------- 
* SME for SSO (saml / oidc / oauth 2.0 / ADFS) 
* SME for VMware vRA/vSphere/NSX-T 
* SME for IBM Cloud (compute, networking (vpc/classic networking) and anything related to VMware SDDC) 

DevOps 
------ 
* Deploying community kubernetes clusters in any public cloud/VMware SDDC/Virtualbox etc. 
* Writing helm charts for javascript/java/python based web applications/micro services. 
* GitOps using FluxCD. 

ITOps 
----- 
* Deploy vRA/vSphere/NSX-T on IBM Cloud from scratch (without using anything from 'IBM Cloud for VMWare Solutions' offering). 
* Wiregurad VPN setup (it was done to overcome absence of client-to-site vpn feature in IBM Cloud VPC/Classic Networking) 
* Hardware based gateway appliance (AT&T vRouter and Juniper vSRX) 

Open Source
-----------
I am an independent reseacher who is working on a number of free/OSS project (https://tinyurl.com/ycrzvje7) to develop innovative products around portal technology/docker/kubernetes/public cloud/VMware based SDDC. Here are some of my projects (sponsors are welcomed for all the projects except Turbine+) - 
* Torque (A UI based tool for designing/deploying k8s applications without any knowledge of kubernetes) 
* Piston (A java/javascript based containerless portal technology) 
* Turbine (A UI based tool to visualize AWS infrastructure) 
* Turbine+ (A UI based tool for visualizing IBM Cloud infrastructure) 
* Bolt (A UI based tool to visualize docker based services) 
* Steam (A UI based tool for developing html mockups for a website using any css framework (e.g bootstrap/bulma))  
* Ignition (A binary protocol server)
